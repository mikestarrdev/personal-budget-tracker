# Project Title:

"Personal Budget Tracker"

# Project Description:

This repository contains the frontend, which was originally intended to be used with the api in this repo: https://github.com/personnamedmike/personal-budget-tracker-api.

This project was for "phase 3" of Flatiron School school's Software Engineering bootcamp. We had 4 days to complete a fullstack app. The assignment was to play around with Active Record, Sinatra, Ruby, and connect it with a React frontend.

In a sense, this project was a second iteration of tzjorden's and my app, "Unrekt Crypto Tracker." https://github.com/personnamedmike/unrekt-crypto-tracker. The key differences were that we wrote cleaner code this time, and implemented our own backend.

This first iteration of Personal Budget Tracker is less buggy than Unrekt Crypto Tracker, and is useful enough to use in your everyday life.

# How to Install and Run Personal Budget Tracker

Currently the best and most secure way to run this project is by forking and cloning both repositories. This repo you're currently in is for the api, and you can fork the frontend here https://personnamedmike.github.io/personal-budget-tracker/.

Running this app on your local machine and storing data on a local sqlite3 database will ensure a base level of privacy of your financial transactions.

# How to use this project

To delete an entry, click on the garbage can icon at the end of its line.

To mark an expense as paid, click on the ðŸ…‡ icon. If a line item is marked with the âœ… icon, that means it's been paid off.

To view a basic summary of your finances, visit the Summary tab. This shows a sum of your income, expenses, and the difference between a sum of both
